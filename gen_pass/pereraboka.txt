Wiltshire is one of the few counties for which returns survive to the parliamentary summonses of  From these fragmentary documents we know that burgesses were returned for the city of New Salisbury the boroughs of Downton Marlborough and Wilton and three ville mercatorie two of which were Cricklade and Malmesbury The number of representatives of Marlborough is unknown three townsmen were returned for Cricklade otherwise in each case there were four citizens burgesses or townsmen fn  It is interesting that the then sheriff deemed Cricklade and Malmesbury to be ville mercatorie rather than boroughs although both were boroughs at the time of the Survey

To the model Parliament of  no fewer than thirteen boroughs were summoned more than from any other county They were the city of New Salisbury described as a borough and the boroughs of Bedwyn Bradford Calne Chippenham Cricklade Devizes Downton Ludgershall Malmesbury Marlborough Old Salisbury and Wilton All made returns fn  One would gladly know what dictated this choice Bedwyn Bradford Calne Cricklade Downton and Ludgershall must have been insignificant places Perhaps indeed they all contained burgage tenements but so did Highworth Lacock and Trowbridge which were not summoned then or later fn  Bradford was never summoned again By  the sheriff had evolved a less comprehensive definition of a borough and summoned only eight towns to which summons Marlborough and Worthe made no return Worthe called Worth liberty in  seems to have been included because Cricklade lay within it fn  To the Parliament of  nine boroughs were summoned fn  to that of  only three In the next four Parliaments  to  the number varied between ten and twelve It then fell to five and from  to  remained at a comparatively low figure In these fluctuations Wiltshire in no way differs from the rest of the kingdom fn  

Within the period  the largest number of boroughs ever summoned was eight in  while in  only New Salisbury was summoned This is an average of almost exactly four The number of boroughs actually returning burgesses was even smaller Though all the boroughs summoned in  sent representatives there were  Parliaments out of a total of  fn  in which one borough or more failed to make a return so that the average number of boroughs represented amounted to no more than  One new borough was represented in this period It was the little town of Mere first summoned in  and again in   and  It made returns only to the first of these Parliaments and never again in history The period is also marked by the temporary extinction as constituencies of Bedwyn Calne Chippenham and Old Salisbury They last returned members in    and  respectively while Downton and Ludgershall made no return after  In fact the period is one in which parliamentary representation of Wiltshire closely corresponded to the realities of its urban life

With the Parliament of  things begin to change Twelve boroughs were summoned in that year though only half of them made returns Ten were summoned in the next The number then falls again in the  ensuing Parliaments the number summoned and represented was only  and  and in the  Parliaments fn  between  and  the average number represented was  Between  and  however there is a marked increase To these  Parliaments fn  an average of  boroughs was summoned and an average of  represented Moreover in the period between  and  old constituencies begin to be revived Bedwyn Calne Chippenham Downton Ludgershall and Old Salisbury were all summoned again in  and all but Bedwyn and Ludgershall were represented Men from Bedwyn sat in the Parliament of  Men from Devizes and Cricklade towns which had not sent representatives since  sat again for the first in  and for the other in  Between  and  Hindon was continuously summoned but its representatives never sat until the middle of the next century

Between  and  there is once again a decline in numbers In the  Parliaments fn  of that period the average number of boroughs summoned and sitting was  Then the number rose again in accordance with a nationwide tendency fn  and never afterwards fell permanently In the  Parliaments fn  between  and  the average number of boroughs represented was  The maximum of  was reached in the latter year and rarely varied thereafter until  fn  In the earlier years of the period the smaller and more freakish boroughs were not regularly represented Bedwyn was dropped between  and  with a single sitting in  Calne between  and  with a single sitting in the second Parliament of  Until the second Parliament of  representatives of Chippenham only sat thrice after  of Cricklade only twice after  and of Ludgershall only once after  Burgesses from Old Salisbury sat four times between  and the first Parliament of  After  however it is unusual for any of these strange places to be omitted Men from Downton which had been represented in the Parliament of  and not again until  sat regularly from  Wootton Bassett was summoned regularly after  Hindon and Westbury from  and Heytesbury the last borough to be added from 

Naturally enough the city of New Salisbury was represented throughout the whole period up to  its representatives in no fewer than  Parliaments are known by name Wilton represented in  Parliaments is not often absent Marlborough was represented  times Malmesbury  and Devizes  No other borough was represented with anything like the same frequency

The constant attendance of burgesses from Wilton may have been due as much to the convention of the county court in that town as to any economic cause The frequent representation of Marlborough is not hard to understand for it was the capital of northern Wiltshire The town of Devizes seems to have declined after the and of Henry IIIs reign when its castle lost much of its military importance and in  its burgesses complained of a restriction of their privileges fn  In  a new charter was granted fn  Nine years from this grant burgesses began to sit in Parliament again fairly regularlyan instance of a real correlation between representation and status

The revival of Old Salisbury as a constituency in  must have had a different cause The town had been declining since the end of the th century at least and by  seems to have housed little more than a gaol and a set of public offices There was therefore nothing to justify its representation on commercial grounds Its revocation to Westminster can only have been due to the desire to find accommodation in Parliament for gentlemen and lawyers for whom existing seats were insufficient fn  Old Salisbury was eminently suitable for this purpose for it can hardly have possessed a vigorous municipal life of its own It was right under the sheriffs eye and it is likely enough that it was largely peopled by his own subordinates fn  Few besides the sheriff can have needed to be squared in order to secure the return of a particular candidate While several other Wiltshire constituencies must have been revived solely with this end in view Old Salisbury seems to be the earliest and the clearest instance

We must suppose that from the first the election of knights of the shire took place in the county court at Wilton and that thither were returned the sheriffs precepts to the boroughs Certainly that was the practice after the inception of the indenture system in  In the early th century however there is a curious case of a return made by a sheriff on his own authority The writ of summons to the Parliament of  did not reach the sheriff until Sunday  January  the day before the return day Notwithstanding the shortness of the time returned the sheriff proudly the knights and many citizens and burgesses were speedily elected fn  Of the constitution of the elective assembly after  a little may be gathered from a study of the indentures Between  and  there are Wiltshire indentures three of them defective fn  for  Parliaments fn  On the basis of these  indentures we may conclude that the average attendance at the Wiltshire county court within the period was  But numbers varied not a little in   electors were present fn  for the election of representatives in the first Parliament of  as few as  fn  

In the earliest times the sheriff of Wiltshire in order to secure borough representation directed his writs either to the elective chief officers of the boroughs or to the bailiffs or chief officers of the liberties in which they lay Thus in  the mayor and bailiffs of Wilton received his writ fn  in  the constable of Devizes castle fn  These officials sent in their returns to the sheriff who transmitted them to the Chancery Such methods were of course normal throughout England In  when the indenture system started a new plan was adopted in Wiltshire the boroughs sent delegates to the county court to make formal election in the presence of the other suitors Thus the bailiffs of hundreds and liberties were bypassed This system which lasted until  was not indeed confined to Wiltshire but extended to the other four southwestern counties all of which like Wiltshire contained an exceptionally large number of boroughs fn  

These meetings of the shire court attended by borough delegates were not however more than the occasion for ratification So far as is known the election in the more modern sense of that word had taken place beforehand in the towns themselves and in private In the case of New Salisbury it has been shown that by the reign of Henry IV such elections were being made in the city assembly fn  by a narrow clique of some  leading citizens How elections were actually conducted elsewhere is hard to determine Schedules attached to indentures for the period between  and  and therefore after the lapse of the delegation system sometimes declare that the mayor and other burgesses have made the choice and name some or all of those burgesses Probably the fullest of these documents is the schedule for Malmesbury returned in  in which an alderman and at least thirteen others are named but the document is so badly stained that it is only partially intelligible fn  The schedule for Wilton in the same year names the mayor and about seven burgesses fn  The representatives of Cricklade in  were elected by the two constables of the hundred and town six named persons and other burgesses fn  The domestic records of Marlborough and Wilton when thoroughly examined may help to make the picture more complete So far as is known no records for other Wiltshire boroughs survive for the period fn  

The first two Wiltshire knights of the shire whose names have been preserved were Henry de Preaux anglicized as Praers and Henry de Thistleden each elected to serve in the Parliament of  The first was perhaps a descendant of Ingram de Preaux who held land in Bemerton Quidhampton and Barford in  fn  In  he was himself the lord of manors in Durnford and Lydiard fn  But his connexions were at least as close with Bedfordshire Buckinghamshire Gloucestershire Northamptonshire and Warwickshire as with Wiltshire He sat in no fewer than six Parliamentsthrice for Wiltshire    twice for Bedfordshire  and once for Gloucestershire  Henry de Thistleden was overlord of ShawinAlton fn  but his lands lay mostly in Hampshire and he was sheriff of Oxfordshire in  He sat thrice in Parliament    always for Wiltshire The remaining known knights who sat in Edward Is Parliaments were William de Cotes    John of Grimstead   Peter FitzWarin   Thomas de St Omer  Hugh Wake  William Lilborne  Adam Walrond     and William de Wodefaude  There is nothing especially remarkable about the careers of any of these men except St Omer who went overseas on two embassies for the king their biographies show them as serving in local offices and receiving summonses to bear arms against the kings enemies like other knights of the time Walrond was much engaged in public work for he was thrice sheriff and thrice a keeper of the peace besides sitting in four Parliaments whether these repeated periods of duty are to be attributed to a desire for office or to a lack of ingenuity in evading it must be a matter of guesswork He had been overlord of Over Stratton before  but was dispossessed on the forfeiture of Adam de Stratton the terre tenant Whether he was reinstated is uncertain but shortly afterwards he was acquiring property in the neighbourhood of Stratton
